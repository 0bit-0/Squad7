## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run any of the projects on your local machine.

1. [Instructions for Bank3 and WBank]
2. [Instructions for Pass and Passenger]
3. [Instructions for Dhami]
4. [Instructions for GuessingGame]

All the instructions are given below..

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure that you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

   - If you prefer using an integrated development environment (IDE), you can use tools like Visual Studio Code. You can download VS Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

2. **Running Projects in VS Code:**
   - Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.
   - Navigate to the Java file you want to run.
   - Click on the "Run" button in the top menu, or use the keyboard shortcut (usually F5) to execute the program.

3. **Running Projects in Command Line:**
   - Open your command prompt (CMD).
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where your project file is located. For example:
     ```
     cd path/to/your/project
     ```
   - Compile the Java file using the `javac` command:
     ```
     javac filename.java
     ```
   - Run the compiled Java program using the `java` command:
     ```
     java filename
     ```

**Note:** Replace "filename" with the actual name of your Java file.

Ensure that you have set up the JDK environment variables correctly to execute Java commands in the command prompt.
